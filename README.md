You can find all about me in my [webpage](https://manueleleonelli.github.io)

Part of my research is in developing R packages for statistical analysis. Here's a list:

- [extrememix](https://github.com/manueleleonelli/extrememix) for estimation of extreme value mixture models
- [stagedtrees](https://github.com/gherardovarando/extrememix) for structural learning of stratified staged trees
- [bnmonitor](https://github.com/gherardovarando/bnmonitor) for sensitivity analysis in Bayesian netowrks
